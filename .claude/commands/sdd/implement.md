$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before implementation)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_implement` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
    
    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Outline

1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):
   - Scan all checklist files in the checklists/ directory
   - For each checklist, count:
     - Total items: All lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     - Completed items: Lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     - Incomplete items: Lines matching `- [ ]`
   - Create a status table:

     ```text
     | Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |
     |-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
     | ux.md     | 12    | 12        | 0          | ✓ PASS |
     | test.md   | 8     | 5         | 3          | ✗ FAIL |
     | security.md | 6   | 6         | 0          | ✓ PASS |
     ```

   - Calculate overall status:
     - **PASS**: All checklists have 0 incomplete items
     - **FAIL**: One or more checklists have incomplete items

   - **If any checklist is incomplete**:
     - Display the table with incomplete item counts
     - **STOP** and ask: "Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)"
     - Wait for user response before continuing
     - If user says "no" or "wait" or "stop", halt execution
     - If user says "yes" or "proceed" or "continue", proceed to step 3

   - **If all checklists are complete**:
     - Display the table showing all checklists passed
     - Automatically proceed to step 3

3. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read `.specify/memory/lessons-learned.md` for cross-feature learnings — filter to entries tagged `[phase:implement]` or `[phase:all]` and note any relevant to the current feature's tech stack or error-prone areas

4. **Project Setup Verification**:
   - **REQUIRED**: Verify `.gitignore` contains essential Ruby/Rails patterns:

   **Detection & Creation Logic**:
   - Check if the repository is a git repo:

     ```sh
     git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null
     ```

   - If `.gitignore` exists: Verify it contains essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only
   - If `.gitignore` is missing: Create with full Rails pattern set

   **Required `.gitignore` Patterns (Rails)**:
   - **Ruby/Rails**: `.bundle/`, `log/`, `tmp/`, `storage/`, `*.gem`, `vendor/bundle/`, `db/*.sqlite3`, `db/*.sqlite3-*`, `public/assets/`
   - **Secrets**: `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `config/master.key`, `config/credentials/*.key`
   - **Universal**: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`

   - Check if Dockerfile* exists → create/verify `.dockerignore` with: `.git/`, `log/`, `tmp/`, `storage/`, `node_modules/`, `.bundle/`, `*.sqlite3`, `.env*`

5. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

6. Execute implementation following the task plan:
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  
   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding
   - **Post-phase verification**: After completing each phase, run `bin/rails test` to catch regressions early. If system tests exist for the phase, also run `bin/rails test:system`.

7. Implementation execution rules:
   - **Setup first**: Initialize config initializers, routes, dependencies
   - **Foundation**: Run migrations, create models, write model tests
   - **Core development**: Implement services, controllers, views per user story
   - **Testing**: Write service tests, controller tests, system tests per story
   - **Polish and validation**: `bin/rubocop`, `bin/brakeman --no-pager`, `bin/ci`

8. Progress tracking and error handling:
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.
   - **LESSONS CAPTURE (errors)**: When a significant implementation problem occurs (dependency conflict, unexpected framework behavior, workaround for a limitation, recurring test failure pattern), append a concise entry to `.specify/memory/lessons-learned.md` under the appropriate section using the entry format documented in that file. Only log problems useful for future features — skip routine debugging and typos. Create the file with its standard header if it does not exist.

9. Completion validation:
   - Verify all required tasks are completed
   - Check that implemented features match the original specification
   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan
   - Report final status with summary of completed work

   **Lessons learned capture (completion)**:
   - Review the implementation session for noteworthy patterns, surprises, or insights
   - Present the user with a brief prompt:
     ```
     ## Lessons Learned

     Implementation complete. Any learnings worth recording for future features?

     Suggested based on this session:
     - [1-3 specific observations from the implementation]

     Reply: (1) Accept suggestions, (2) Add your own, (3) Skip
     ```
   - If the user provides input, append entries to `.specify/memory/lessons-learned.md`
   - If the user skips, proceed without writing
   - Create the file with its standard header if it does not exist

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/sdd:tasks` first to regenerate the task list.

10. **Check for extension hooks**: After completion validation, check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
    - If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_implement` key
    - If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
    - Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
    - For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
      - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
      - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
    - For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
      - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
        ```
        ## Extension Hooks

        **Optional Hook**: {extension}
        Command: `/{command}`
        Description: {description}

        Prompt: {prompt}
        To execute: `/{command}`
        ```
      - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
        ```
        ## Extension Hooks

        **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
        Executing: `/{command}`
        EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
        ```
    - If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently
